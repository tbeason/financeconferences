# Finance Conference Deadlines

http://tbeason.com/financeconferences/

This is a simple public listing of submission deadlines for academic or research-oriented finance conferences. 

The list is in no way comprehensive. The American Finance Association also maintains a [calendar](https://afajof.org/call-for-papers-calendar/).

If you would like a conference added to the list, please open an [issue](https://github.com/tbeason/financeconferences/issues). I have created a template to make it straightforward. Alternatively, you can add your conference to the file `data/financeconfdeadlines.csv` and submit a pull request.

This list comes with no guarantees.
