# Contributing to this repository

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

### Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers.

If you are adding a conference to the calendar:
 1. Fork the current `master` branch of the repository.
 2. Add your conference to the `data/financeconfdeadlines.csv`. Be sure to follow the existing styles:
     - Informative conference name
     - Dates follow d/m/yyyy (no leading zeros on day or month, all 4 digits for year)
     - Submission fee is just a number (in USD). Blank if not known or other condition.
     - Website beginning with `http://` or `https://`. It will not turn into a clickable link without it.
 3. Submit a Pull Request against the `master` branch of this repository.

If you cannot follow those steps, please just make an issue and use the template.
 
If you are making changes to the website (beyond just adding a conference), perhaps to add a new feature, please follow the standard Pull Request procedure and include an informative PR message.
